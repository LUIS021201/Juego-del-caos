Code Analysis

Objective:
The objective of the "is_point_in_triangle" function is to determine whether a given point is inside a triangle or not. This function takes four arguments, which are the coordinates of the point and the three vertices of the triangle.

Inputs:
- p: a tuple representing the coordinates of the point to be checked
- a: a tuple representing the coordinates of the first vertex of the triangle
- b: a tuple representing the coordinates of the second vertex of the triangle
- c: a tuple representing the coordinates of the third vertex of the triangle

Flow:
- Calculate the vectors representing the three sides of the triangle
- Calculate the dot products of the vectors
- Calculate the barycentric coordinates of the point
- Check if the point is inside the triangle
- Return True if the point is inside the triangle, False otherwise

Outputs:
- True if the point is inside the triangle
- False if the point is outside the triangle

Additional aspects:
- The function uses the barycentric coordinate system to determine if the point is inside the triangle.
- The dot product is used to calculate the barycentric coordinates of the point.
- The function assumes that the vertices of the triangle are given in a counterclockwise order.
